# üîê Smart Contract Security Best Practices Guide

When web3 users are asked what influences their preference for one decentralized application (dApp) over another, **security** often emerges as a primary concern. Users seek platforms that have never been hacked and demonstrate a serious commitment to security. 

While there is extensive literature on smart contract vulnerabilities, discussions surrounding best practices and preventative measures are frequently underrepresented. Security extends beyond merely identifying flaws; it involves proactively integrating protective measures at every stage of the smart contract development process. 

This guide aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for best practices across the software development lifecycle: Design, Coding, Testing, Pre-Deployment, Deployment, Ongoing Upgrades, and Ongoing Operations. If you are starting a new project or looking to strengthen the security practices of your current one, this guide can act as a one-stop shop, helping you navigate the complexities of secure development and deployment. By covering every phase of the lifecycle, it provides actionable insights and frameworks to minimize vulnerabilities, streamline workflows, and establish a culture of security from inception to operation.
