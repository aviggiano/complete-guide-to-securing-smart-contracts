# Smart Contracts Security Best Practices
While much has been written about smart contract vulnerabilities, discussions around best practices and preventative measures are often lacking. Security is not just about identifying flaws but about proactively embedding protection throughout every stage of the smart contract development process. The following list provides a set of best practices focused on minimizing risks before they arise, ensuring that security is built into the code from the ground up.
