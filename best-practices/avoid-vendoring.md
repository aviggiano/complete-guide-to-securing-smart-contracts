## Avoid Vendoring Dependencies

Vendoring smart contracts and libraries, or directly copying them into your project, might seem like a simple way to control dependencies and ensure reliability. However, this approach has its drawbacks and can introduce significant risks in the long run. Below are the key reasons why vendoring smart contracts and libraries should generally be avoided.

### 1. **Security Risks and Dependency Management**

One of the primary issues with vendoring smart contracts or libraries is the difficulty of managing security vulnerabilities over time. When you vendor code, you're essentially locking your project into a specific version of the library or contract, which makes it harder to benefit from future security updates. 

- If a vulnerability is discovered in the vendored code, you will need to manually update your project to fix it. This can be error-prone and time-consuming.
- If the original repository pushes out a patch or fix, you might miss it or delay applying it to your vendored version, leaving your project exposed to known vulnerabilities.

Instead, using **package managers** or **external repositories** ensures that you can easily update and audit dependencies whenever a security patch is released. With package managers, you're always working with the most up-to-date and secure versions.

### 2. **Lack of Transparency and Auditing**

When you vendor libraries, the external code is embedded directly within your project, which can make it harder to keep track of changes over time. If you don’t regularly update and re-audit the vendored code, it can quickly become outdated, introducing bugs or vulnerabilities that were not present when it was first added to the project.

Vendoring also hinders the **auditability** of your code because the source of the vendored code may no longer be easily traceable. This is problematic for security audits or compliance checks, as auditors may not have access to the latest changes or the original context in which the code was maintained.

Using versioned packages from trusted repositories or package managers like **npm** or **yarn** ensures that external libraries are transparent, trackable, and auditable. These tools also integrate with tools like **Solidity** linters, auditors, and security scanners, which can help catch potential issues before deployment.

### 3. **Compatibility and Upgradability Issues**

As blockchain technology evolves rapidly, it’s essential to stay current with the latest developments in libraries and smart contracts. Vendoring can lock you into older versions of libraries, making it difficult to update your code to take advantage of new features, optimizations, or improvements.

- Smart contracts can evolve to handle new features, address new vulnerabilities, or interact with the latest blockchain protocols. If you're vendoring code, upgrading to new versions may require extensive refactoring or risk breaking existing functionality.
- Using package managers with version control allows you to easily upgrade to newer versions of libraries with minimal effort, while maintaining compatibility with your existing contracts.

### 4. **Increased Project Complexity**

Vendoring introduces unnecessary complexity to your project. Since vendored libraries are directly copied into your codebase, it becomes harder to track and manage dependencies, especially when multiple vendored contracts or libraries are used.

This can lead to conflicts between different versions of the same dependency or make it difficult to integrate new features or fix bugs without causing regressions. Moreover, if you need to share or open-source your code, vendoring makes it harder for other developers to understand or contribute to the project, as they would need to dig into the vendored code and dependencies.

### 5. **Better Alternatives: Package Managers and External Repositories**

Instead of vendoring, it’s best to rely on **package managers** like **npm** or **yarn** for JavaScript-based libraries, or Solidity-specific package management tools like **Forge** or **Hardhat**. These tools allow you to manage dependencies efficiently, ensuring that you always use the correct version of external libraries without manually copying code into your repository.
