## Design A Role Based Access Control Model

dApps are, by design, multi-role systems with multiple types of users who require different permissions. To manage this complexity securely, it is highly advisable to map out the systemâ€™s assets and actions, then establish a [**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Model**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol) to govern permissions based on user roles rather than individual identities.

An RBAC model allows developers to define specific roles, such as administrator, owner or user, and grant each role distinct permissions aligned with their access needs and responsibilities. By restricting functions to specific roles, dApps can prevent unauthorized actions, reduce the likelihood of accidental or malicious misuse, and streamline permission management.

Implementing RBAC also makes the system more modular, allowing adjustments to roles and permissions without overhauling the entire access control structure. This approach is essential to ensure security and operational clarity in decentralized environments where multiple actors interact with the contract autonomously.
