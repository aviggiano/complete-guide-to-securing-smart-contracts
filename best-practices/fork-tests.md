## Develop Comprehensive Fork Tests

Fork testing involves replicating the current state of a live blockchain, like Ethereum mainnet, into a local development environment to test smart contracts against real-world data. This approach allows developers to evaluate how new contracts interact with live state, including existing tokens, liquidity pools, and other deployed contracts. 

By testing in a forked environment, you can uncover security issues that arise from interactions with external systems, such as misconfigured oracles, unexpected token behaviors, or dependency failures.

This method is invaluable for detecting edge cases that wouldn't surface in a purely simulated or testnet environment. Fork testing helps validate that a contract is robust against real-world conditions, reducing the risk of exploits after deployment. Itâ€™s an essential step for complex protocols where interactions with existing on-chain infrastructure are critical.
