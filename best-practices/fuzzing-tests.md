## Develop Comprehensive Fuzzing Tests

Fuzzing tests are an essential tool in the smart contract security arsenal, as they help uncover vulnerabilities by bombarding contracts with random or unexpected inputs. Unlike traditional testing methods that rely on predefined scenarios, fuzzing exposes contracts to a wide range of edge cases that developers might not anticipate.
This approach is particularly valuable for detecting issues such as arithmetic issues, and improper input validationâ€”common vulnerabilities that attackers often exploit.
Fuzzing can also reveal how contracts behave under extreme conditions, such as high transaction volume or invalid state transitions, providing insights into potential denial-of-service risks.
By simulating unpredictable real-world usage, fuzzing helps ensure that smart contracts can withstand both accidental errors and deliberate attacks, making the system more robust and secure.
