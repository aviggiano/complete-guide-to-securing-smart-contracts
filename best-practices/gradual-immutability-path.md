### Design a Gradual Path Towards Immutability

While decentralization is a core principle, achieving a flawless, bug-free smart contract at launch is extremely challenging. Instead, immutability should be approached as a gradual process, where the code’s resilience improves over time through broader usage, community review, and rigorous testing. Therefore, it’s often advisable to adopt a staged approach to immutability: begin with a select few contracts marked as immutable and expand this over time as confidence in the code grows. In practical terms, only a small subset of contracts, if any, should be immutable at launch, with the rest designed to be upgradeable.

Factors that increase confidence in a contract include its code maturity, widespread use and auditing, and whether its logic is self-contained and isolated. Conversely, if a component is newly developed, interacts with another upgradeable smart contract, uses a novel algorithm, or has complex logic, deploying it as an upgradeable contract is often the safer route.

For example, token contracts derived directly from trusted libraries are good candidates for immutability. On the other hand, a new automated market maker (AMM) model based on complex mathematics would be better suited for an upgradeable contract. As the system matures and contracts become battle-tested, the [Security Council](./security-council.md) can regularly evaluate and decide which components are ready to be made immutable.
