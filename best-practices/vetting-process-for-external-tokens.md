## Vetting Process For External Tokens

When integrating external tokens (such as ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155) with your system, it's essential to conduct a rigorous vetting process to prevent integration errors and security risks. Begin by thoroughly reviewing the token's code to ensure it complies with the relevant standard and behaves as expected. For instance, some ERC-20 tokens may have centralized controls, blacklists, or transfer restrictions that could lead to unexpected denial-of-service issues within your contract. 

Additionally, certain tokens—like elastic supply tokens or fee-on-transfer tokens—may introduce balance discrepancies due to their unique mechanics, potentially breaking assumptions about balance tracking in your system. Tokens like USDT, which do not return a success value upon transfers, require special handling to ensure transaction outcomes are properly validated.
