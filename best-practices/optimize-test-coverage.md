## Track and Optimize Test Coverage

Tracking and optimizing test coverage is crucial in smart contract development, especially from a security standpoint, as it ensures that critical paths, conditions, and edge cases are thoroughly tested. Incomplete coverage can leave vulnerabilities undiscovered, which attackers could exploit once the contract is deployed.
Integrating test coverage metrics into the CI/CD pipeline using tools like Hardhat (solidity-coverage) or Foundry (forge coverage) is not just beneficial—it’s essential.
These tools offer built-in support or plugins for generating coverage reports, which should automatically run during each build. By enforcing minimum coverage thresholds, teams can maintain a high standard of security across all code changes. Additionally, automated reports help identify untested or poorly tested code sections, guiding developers to improve test suites incrementally.
Including test coverage as a mandatory step in the CI/CD pipeline ensures that security remains a continuous, automated process rather than an afterthought, ultimately reducing the risk of deploying vulnerable contracts.

In terms of thresholds, **statement coverage** should be at least 95%, ensuring that most lines of code are executed during tests. **Branch coverage**, which checks whether all possible branches in control structures (like `if` or `require` statements) are tested, should be no lower than 90%. **Function coverage** should ideally be close to 100%, ensuring all functions are invoked. While striving for high coverage, developers should balance thorough testing with practical deployment timelines, recognizing that coverage alone doesn't guarantee security—it must be coupled with quality tests targeting known vulnerabilities.
