## External Security Reviews

Engaging external security experts to review the code is crucial for ensuring the robustness of smart contracts and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. Just as the three-way handshake establishes a reliable connection by exchanging critical information, the audit process similarly unfolds in stages. 

The first stage, represented by the **SYN**, corresponds to the issues identified by the security researchers during their initial review. The subsequent **SYN-ACK** phase involves the development team implementing fixes based on the security researchers' findings. Finally, the **ACK** phase signifies the security researchers verifying these fixes, confirming that the issues have been addressed effectively.

### How to Prepare for a Security Review

1. **Pick the Right Security Researchers**  
   Choose researchers with the relevant expertise and a proven track record. It's crucial to select professionals you can trust to act ethically and transparently. Look for researchers who specialize in smart contract security and have demonstrated success in similar projects.

2. **Assess the Effort (Time and Budget)**  
   Ask the security researchers to assess the time and budget required for the review. This will ensure you have realistic expectations and resources in place to complete the review and fix any identified issues.

3. **Prepare Documentation**  
   Provide comprehensive documentation to help the security researchers better understand your system. This might include architecture diagrams, an overview of the contract's logic, dependencies, and other relevant details. The more context they have, the more effective their review will be.

4. **Identify Areas of Concern**  
   Prepare a list of areas where you specifically want extra assurance. This can include complex logic, integrations with other contracts, or areas that you know may carry higher risk. By highlighting these areas, you can ensure that the review is focused and efficient.

5. **Thoroughly Test Before the Review**  
   Ensure your smart contracts have been thoroughly tested before undergoing the external security review. This will help you catch basic flaws and ensure that the researchers can focus on more complex issues rather than spending time on fundamental mistakes.

6. **Allocate Time for Fixes**  
   Pre-allocate sufficient time for addressing any issues found during the review. After the audit, there will be fixes to implement and further testing to conduct. Be sure to budget adequate time for additional tests to ensure everything works as expected before deployment.

### Categorization of Issues to Address in the Security Review

To ensure a thorough security review, security researchers will typically categorize potential issues into the following areas. It's important to note that these lists are **partial** and are meant to serve as examples of the most common vulnerabilities. There may be other, more specific issues depending on the contract's complexity and functionality.

1. **Well-Known Solidity Vulnerabilities**
   - **Overflows**: Integer overflow and underflow that may lead to unintended behavior.
   - **Reentrancy attacks**: Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to repeatedly call a contract in a malicious manner.
   - **Out-of-gas denial of service**: Situations where the contract fails due to running out of gas.
   - **Front-running**: Attacks where transactions can be manipulated by seeing a pending transaction.
   - **Upgradeability issues**: Problems arising from improper upgradeability mechanisms that can affect contract behavior.

2. **Well-Known Coding Vulnerabilities**
   - **Off-by-one errors**: Common coding mistake where an array or loop index is incorrect by one.
   - **Digital signature issues**: Improper handling or verification of digital signatures.
   - **Lack of access control**: Inadequate protections against unauthorized users interacting with critical functions.

3. **Well-Known Economic/MEV Vulnerabilities**
   - **Arbitrage**: Opportunities for risk-free profits in decentralized finance systems.
   - **Price manipulation**: Exploiting contract mechanisms to artificially alter asset prices.
   - **Just-in-time (JIT) liquidity**: Exploiting liquidity pools for short-term profit opportunities without proper liquidity backing.

4. **Application-Specific/Business Logic Vulnerabilities**
   - Issues tied to how the contract interacts with business logic, user behavior, and expected outcomes. These vulnerabilities arise when the contract logic doesn't align with real-world expectations or assumptions.

Additionally, if proper documentation is provided, we also cover:

5. **Specification Mismatch Issues**
   - **Discrepancies between the specification and the implementation**: Misalignment between the contract's intended behavior and its actual implementation.

6. **Specification Design Issues**
   - **Flaws in the specification itself**: Mistakes or gaps in the design of the contract's functional specification that could lead to vulnerabilities or poor behavior.
