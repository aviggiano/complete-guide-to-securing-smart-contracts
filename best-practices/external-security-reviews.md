## External Security Reviews

Engaging external security experts to review the code is crucial for ensuring the robustness of smart contracts and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. Just as the three-way handshake establishes a reliable connection by exchanging critical information, the audit process similarly unfolds in stages. 

The first stage, represented by the **SYN**, corresponds to the issues identified by the auditors during their initial review. The subsequent **SYN-ACK** phase involves the development team implementing fixes based on the auditors' findings. Finally, the **ACK** phase signifies the auditors verifying these fixes, confirming that the issues have been addressed effectively. 

To ensure a thorough review, it’s vital to engage a team of auditors with diverse expertise, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation from multiple perspectives. Rushing through the audit process can lead to oversight, so it’s essential to pre-allocate sufficient time not only for selecting the right team but also for allowing ample time to fix the code before launching the project. This deliberate approach enhances security and builds user confidence, ultimately contributing to the project's long-term success.
