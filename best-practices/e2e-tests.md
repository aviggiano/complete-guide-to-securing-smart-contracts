### Conduct End to End Testing on Testnet

Conducting end-to-end (E2E) tests for smart contracts involves simulating the entire lifecycle of a contract’s interaction with other contracts, users, and external systems to ensure the system behaves as intended in real-world scenarios.
This type of testing is essential for identifying issues that unit tests or integration tests might miss, such as incorrect token transfers, improper handling of multi-step transactions, or vulnerabilities that arise only when different system components work together.
In the context of smart contracts, where security is paramount due to the immutable and public nature of blockchain transactions, E2E testing can reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
It’s important to test various conditions, including edge cases and unexpected user inputs, to ensure the smart contract performs securely and efficiently.
By conducting thorough E2E tests, developers can gain confidence that their smart contract will function as expected when deployed in a live environment, minimizing the risk of security breaches and financial loss.
