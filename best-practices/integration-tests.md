## Develop Comprehensive Integration Tests

Integration tests are critical for ensuring the security of smart contracts because they focus on the interactions between different contracts and external systems. In decentralized applications, vulnerabilities often arise not from isolated components but from the way contracts communicate with each other, handle tokens, or depend on external oracles and data feeds.

Integration tests simulate these real-world interactions to uncover flaws of unexpected edge cases between contracts, incorrect handling of token transfers, or misconfigured permissions across modules. By exposing potential attack vectors that unit tests might miss, integration tests provide a deeper layer of validation, reducing the risk of costly exploits once the system is live.
