## Funds Isolation By Design
Many smart contracts pool users' funds together and implement accounting logic on top of this shared pool, which may work effectively if there are no bugs. However, a flaw in the accounting logic can compromise the logical isolation of the contracts, potentially allowing attackers to steal all users' funds. To enhance security, smart contracts can be designed with isolation from the outset. For example, instead of aggregating the vesting allocations of all recipients in a single contract, each recipient could receive a pre-allocated amount in their own cloned contract. This approach limits the impact of any bugs in the vesting logic and makes it more difficult for an attacker to exploit multiple contracts, reducing the risk associated with a single point of failure. However, it's important to note that this architecture complicates maintenance and upgrades, as each individual contract would need to be upgraded separately rather than updating a single contract.
