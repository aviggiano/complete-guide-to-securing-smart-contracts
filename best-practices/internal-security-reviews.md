## Internal Security Reviews

Immanuel Kant, a proponent of critical thinking, famously said, *"Dare to know! Have the courage to use your own understanding."* Much like ideas, code becomes more robust when it is subjected to scrutiny and challenge. The initial group to test new code should be the development team itself.

It is highly advisable to allocate time after coding is completed for a collaborative effort aimed at identifying vulnerabilities and issues. Additionally, ensure that components are reviewed by developers who did not write the original code, as this fresh perspective can uncover hidden flaws and enhance overall code quality.
